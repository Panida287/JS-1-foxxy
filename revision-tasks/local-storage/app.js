// Create a Note-Taking Application with Local Storage
// Objective:
// Develop a simple web-based note-taking application that allows users to add, view, and delete notes. This task emphasizes the use of local storage to save, retrieve, and manipulate data on the client side, ensuring that the user's notes persist between browser sessions.

// Requirements:
// HTML Structure:

// An input field (or <textarea>) for entering note content.
// A button to add the note to the list.
// A list (e.g., <ul> or <div>) to display all added notes with an option to delete individual notes.
// JavaScript Functionality:

// Upon adding a note, save it to local storage and update the displayed list of notes.
// On page load, retrieve and display notes saved in local storage.
// Implement a way to delete individual notes from local storage and update the display accordingly.
// Detailed Instructions:
// Project Setup:

// Create an index.html file for your application's structure.
// Optionally, create a style.css file to style your application.
// Create a script.js file for your application logic.
// Implementing JavaScript:

// Use localStorage to store the notes. Consider using an array to manage multiple notes and converting this array to a string with JSON.stringify() when saving to local storage.
// Retrieve the notes from local storage using JSON.parse() to convert the saved string back into an array.
// On page load, check local storage for saved notes and display them.
// Implement a function to add new notes to local storage and update the displayed list.
// Include a mechanism to delete notes, both from the local storage array and the page.
// Enhancements and Challenges:

// Add a feature to edit existing notes, updating both the display and local storage.
// Implement note categories or tags for better organization, allowing users to filter notes by category.
// Explore using more advanced local storage management techniques, such as indexedDB, for larger data storage needs.
