// 1)
// Mastering Conditional Logic with User Input
// Task Description
// Create a JavaScript program that uses conditional logic (if/else statements) to provide customized responses based on user input. The program will simulate a basic quiz system where the user is asked a question, and based on their answer (stored in a variable), the program will display different messages. Follow these steps:

// User Input Simulation:

// Instead of real-time user input, simulate it by storing predetermined answers in variables. For example, create a variable named userAnswer and assign it a value that represents a possible answer to a quiz question.
// Quiz Question:

// Your program should include at least one quiz question. For example, "What is the capital of France?" The correct answer is "Paris".
// Conditional Logic:

// Use if/else statements to compare the userAnswer variable to the correct answer. Depending on whether the answer is correct, display a message.
// Extended Functionality:

// Add an else-if condition to handle common incorrect answers (e.g., if someone answers "Lyon", you might want to display a specific message for that guess).
// Output:

// The program should output a message that either congratulates the user for the correct answer, provides a specific response for certain incorrect answers, or informs them that their answer was incorrect.
// 2)
// Mastering Conditional Logic with If-Else Statements
// Task Description
// Create a JavaScript program that simulates a basic book recommendation system based on the user's preference for genre and the time they have available to read. Your program should follow these steps:

// User Preferences:

// Declare two variables to store the user's preferred genre (e.g., "fiction", "non-fiction", "fantasy") and the amount of time they have available to read in hours (e.g., 5 hours).
// Book Recommendations:

// Your program should have a set of book recommendations stored in an array or object for at least three genres. Each book recommendation should include a title, an estimated reading time in hours, and its genre.
// Decision Logic:

// Using if-else statements, write logic to recommend a book based on the user's genre preference and the time they have available. Consider the following criteria:
// If the user prefers "fiction" and has more than 6 hours available, recommend a longer fiction book.
// If the user prefers "fiction" but has less than 6 hours, recommend a shorter fiction book.
// Apply similar logic for other genres.
// Include an else statement for when no suitable book is found (e.g., no books fit the time constraint).
// Output:

// Log a message to the console with the book recommendation, or a message indicating that no suitable book was found.
