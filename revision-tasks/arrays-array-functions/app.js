// Build a Dynamic Shopping List Application
// Objective:
// Create a shopping list application that allows users to add items to a list, view the list, remove items from the list, and filter items based on a search query. This task will help you understand how to work with arrays in JavaScript, including creating arrays, accessing and manipulating their elements, and utilizing methods like push, splice, filter, and more.

// Requirements:
// HTML Structure:

// An input field for entering shopping list items.
// A button to add the entered item to the shopping list.
// An optional input field for filtering items by name.
// A <div> or <ul> element to display the shopping list.
// Buttons or links next to each item for removing them from the list.
// JavaScript Functionality:

// Use an array to store the list of shopping items.
// Implement function(s) to add items to the array and update the displayed list.
// Implement a function to remove an item from the array and update the displayed list.
// If implementing a filter feature, use the filter method to display items that match the search query.
// Ensure that the UI is updated every time an item is added, removed, or the list is filtered.
// Detailed Instructions:
// Initialize Your Project:

// Create an HTML file (index.html) with the described structure.
// Optionally, add a CSS file (style.css) to style your application.
// Create a JavaScript file (script.js) where your array manipulation and event handling code will reside.
// Implementing JavaScript:

// Start by declaring an empty array to store your shopping list items.
// Add an event listener to the "Add Item" button to capture the input value and add it to your array using the push method. Then, call a function to update the displayed list.
// To display the list, iterate over the array and dynamically create HTML elements (e.g., <li> tags) for each item, inserting them into your display <div> or <ul>.
// Implement a removal function that uses the splice method to remove an item from the array based on its index or value, then update the display.
// If implementing filtering, add an event listener to the filter input field that uses the filter method on your array to display only items that match the query.
// Goal:

// Understand how to create and manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
// Learn to dynamically update the HTML DOM based on array data.
// Gain experience with event handling and array method applications in a real-world scenario.
