// Task Description
// Create a JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of for, while, and do...while loops. The program should accomplish the following tasks using each type of loop, illustrating their structures, differences, and appropriate use cases:

// for Loop:

// Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and print each number to the console. This task demonstrates the use of for loops for scenarios where the number of iterations is known ahead of time.
// while Loop:

// Simulate a guessing game where the user tries to guess a predetermined number (e.g., 7). Use a while loop to keep the game running until the user guesses the number correctly. The user's guess will be simulated by a variable, so initially set it to a wrong number and update it within the loop for demonstration purposes.
// do...while Loop:

// Use a do...while loop to simulate a process where at least one iteration is required, such as asking a user for input until they provide a valid response. For this task, create a scenario where you increment a counter until it reaches a certain condition that would realistically require at least one attempt, showcasing the do...while loop's guarantee of running at least once.
