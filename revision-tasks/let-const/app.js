//#region Task Specification
// Programming Task: Using let and const in a Book Store Website
// Task Description
// You are tasked with creating a small JavaScript snippet for a book store website. Your code will demonstrate the appropriate use of let and const by managing a shopping cart and store settings. Follow these guidelines:

// Variable Declaration:

// Use let to declare a variable cartItemCount that represents the number of items in a shopping cart, starting at 0.
// Use const to declare a variable BOOK_PRICE that represents the fixed price of a book.
// Use const to declare an object storeSettings that includes properties for theme (e.g., "light" or "dark") and currency (e.g., "USD").
// Modification:

// Simulate adding books to the cart by incrementing cartItemCount.
// Attempt to modify BOOK_PRICE to demonstrate its immutability.
// Change the theme property of the storeSettings object to demonstrate how properties of an object declared with const can be modified.
// Output:

// Print the initial and final states of your variables to the console, showing how they've been updated.
